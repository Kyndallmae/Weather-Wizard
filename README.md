# Weather-Wizard
An app to tell you the weather for the next 5 days.

## Description
This app allows users to search for their city and pull up a five day weather forcast. This app is great for people who travel quite often and fine themselves in different cities. They can search for the weather in their current city and know what to expect in the coming days. 

## How To Install
You can use this app straight from the browser or you can download the code from the repo. Just follow the link below to install the app on your local device. 

## How To Use
All you need to do is input the sity you want to see and hit search. The app does the rest and shows you the forcast five days out. 

## Collaboraters
I worked on this mainly on my own, but did have assistance from the tutors, the teachers, and my peers. This is still a work in progress.
